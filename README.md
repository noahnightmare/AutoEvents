``events <name>`` - runs the event specified
``eventskip`` - stops events from being ran this round
``relativepos`` - helper command: returns the relative position of the player and the room they are in.
``.role`` - allows the event winner to choose their role next round
``.vote`` - allows players to vote for the event when an event vote starts

## Current Events

Ball Survival - Everyone spawns in old 173’s room and SCP-018’s will randomly spawn around the room. The last person to survive wins!

DogHideAndSeek - Everyone spawns as Class-D in a light containment. One random player is chosen to be the starting seeker (the 939). Class-D that die will turn into 939 and join the seeker team. The last player alive wins!

GrenadeSurvival - Everyone spawns in old 173’s room and grenades will spawn on a random player with incrementally decreasing timers and fuse times. This may get hectic! The last person to survive wins!

HideAndSeekLight - Everyone spawns as Class-D in Light. One random player is chosen to be the starting seeker (the 049). Everyone will be small to find extra hiding spots! Class-D that die will turn into 049-2 and join the seeker team. The last player alive wins!

HideAndSeekHeavy - Everyone spawns as Class-D in Heavy. One random player is chosen to be the starting seeker (the 049). Everyone will be small to find extra hiding spots! Class-D that die will turn into 049-2 and join the seeker team. The last player alive wins!

NukeRun - All players are spawned as Class-D with 4 colas. The nuke is set to explode instantly - the first person to escape the facility wins! Just don’t drink too many colas…

PeanutSurvival - Everyone spawns as a Class-D trapped in 079’s room. One person is selected to be the starting 173, and people that die will turn into 106. Last player alive wins!

ProtectThePresident - One person spawns as the president (a scientist) and a set amount of MTF will protect him (based on player count). The rest of the players spawn as Chaos. The MTF must escort him to the escape to win. If the President dies, Chaos win!

SmallRound - Normal round, but everyone is tiny!

TeamDeathmatch - MTF Sergeants vs Chaos Riflemen on surface zone, who will win in this team vs team deathmatch?

ZombieEscape - Players are all set to Class-D and spawn in their cells. A scalable amount of players are set to be the starting zombies (based on the amount of players). Zombies have god mode for the first 60 seconds of the game. The objective of the humans is to escape the facility, but each zone opens periodically - and each time it does, everyone gets better weapons, and the zombies get buffed. Everyone in the previous zone will be killed after a certain period of time. Can you survive and make it to the end?
